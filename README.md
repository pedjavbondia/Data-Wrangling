# Data-Wrangling
In this file I am visualizing the data, noticing that the dates column is an 'object' format therefore it was changed to a 'date_time' format. Finally a new column called 'Day_of_the_Week' was added taking the Day of the week from the 'Last_Visited' column and adding it to that column.
